The Intersection Observer API


The Intersection Observer API allows you to configure a callback that is called when either of these circumstances occur:

1. A target element intersects either the device's viewport or a specified element. That specified element is called the root
   element or root for the purposes of the Intersection Observer API.
   (So here the target element is image whose ref we are passing, and root we are considering here viewport as per our requiremt, but can be a specific elemnt as well)
2. The first time the observer is initially asked to watch a target element.

The list of entries received by the callback includes one entry for each target which reported a change in its intersection status. 
Check the value of the isIntersecting property to see if the entry represents an element that currently intersects with the root.
Be aware that your callback is executed on the main thread. It should operate as quickly as possible; if anything time-consuming 
needs to be done, use Window.requestIdleCallback().
